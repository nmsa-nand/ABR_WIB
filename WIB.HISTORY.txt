HISTORY:
 2024-01-14 v1.0 - Nandgate/NMSA - "The Release Edition"
  Changes: Optimizations

 2023-12-17 v0.4 - Nandgate/NMSA
   Changes:
   Bug fixing: UNCMTTT, SETSLAVE method 2
   Script now keeps track if a INFO file is changed, for ReturnCode:
    Using Parameter "FILE <file.info>", after processing, script exits with:
     RC=0 : info file processed and updated
     RC=1 : info file processed, but not updated
    Using Parameter "DIR <file.info>", after processing, script exits with:
     RC=0 : all info files processed, and some/all updated
     RC=1 : all info files processed, no file was updated
   However, with these changes, processing now is a bit slower

 2023-11-13 v0.3 - Nandgate/NMSA - "The Parsers Edition"
  Changes:
  Added Parameters:
   FILE, SETEAINFO, QUIET
  Tooltype EXECUTEARGS has new specification. The "LIST" and
  "CONFIG" parameter names shrunk to a single char, from:
    EXECUTEARGS=LIST <list> CONFIG <config>
  to:
    EXECUTEARGS=L <list> C <config> I <fullpath-to-file.info>
  which requires reprocessing of all INFO files set with previous
  versions. Also, added new param I, for the INFO file fullpath,
  which is added using new script parameter SETEAINFO.
  Updated WIB.README.txt, WHDLoad-Startup, WHDLoad-Cleanup

  Updated WIB.README.txt

 2023-10-16 v0.1 - Nandgate/NMSA - Created

==============================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES:

- For some unknown reason, script WIB.REXX can't update this INFO:

    D/DragonTiles/DragonTiles.info

  I traced the problem back to the "FileToTT" utility that the script uses.
  Being an external program, there is nothing I can do.
  In the end, you have to update the above INFO file manually.
