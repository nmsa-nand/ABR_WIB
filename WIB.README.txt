To make a backup of all .info files to "backupinfos.lha":

  cd <root_dir_of_whdload_collection_files>
  lha -r a backupinfos.lha #?.info

To restore backup if needed:

  cd <root_dir_of_whdload_collection_files>
  lha x backupinfos.lha

FAQ:

Q) So, what's this?

 I made this AREXX script for Batch setting ToolType
 "EXECUTEARGS=C <slave_name>" on the .info files used by
 WHDLoad. The ToolType is meant to be used with the "ABR.rexx" script.

Q) What can "WIB.rexx" do?

 Currently, it traverses a directory and it's subdirectories looking for
 .info files, and then it can do some operations with those files:

  1) Add/set "EXECUTEARGS=C <slave_name>" to ALL .info files which have
     a ToolType "SLAVE=slave_name".

  2) Add/Set ToolTypes.

  3) Delete ToolTypes, which are not commented.

  4) Comment and uncomment ToolTypes.

  5) Create a CFG file from all .info files with ToolType SLAVE.
     The CFG file is to be used with the "ABR.rexx" script.

Q) What is the script performance?

  For the "SETEACFG CREATECFG" options running on a ~4000 .info/slave
  files collection, should take < 30 min running in WINUAE on a moddern PC.
  On a real Amiga will take way longer, depending on the hardware used.
  Using more command line parameters will of course take more time.

Q) What AmigaOS were used to test this?

  AmigaOS 3.2.2.1
  AmigaOS 3.9
  AmigaOS 3.5
  AmigaOS 3.1 with ClassicWorkbench v28

  others may work.
  They just need to have AREXX installed, and Assigns adjusted.

Q) So, this is a small FAQ?

  For more info, consult the README of the "ABR.rexx" script.

INSTALLATION:

How to install?

1) Copy "WIB.rexx" to your REXX: directory:

  copy WIB#? REXX:

2) Go to Aminet and grab "IconPrgs" (or "IconHelper"):

  http://aminet.net/package/util/cli/IconPrgs
  http://aminet.net/package/util/misc/iconhelper

3) Decompress "IconPrgs.lha":

  lha x IconPrgs.lha ram:

  NOTE: if you need "lha" executable, you can grab it here:
        http://aminet.net/package/util/arc/lha

4) Copy required "IconPrgs" executables to SYS:C

  copy FileToTT C:
  copy TTToFile C:

5) For this to work, you will need at least WHDLoad version 18.9,
   which supports "EXECUTEARGS".

6) Done!

==============================================================================
PARAMETERS AND WHAT THEY DO:

- LOG
  Log all script output to a specified file.
  Note that this will slow down processing time.

- ALTSCAN
  Use alternate method to scan INFO files.
  By default, scan method is based on buggy AmigaDOS shell LIST command,
  which may fail traversal for some reason - it happens.
  The LIST command also gets all INFO files.
  Using ALTSCAN will use AREXX to list INFO files, and also
  discards some un-eligible INFO files, for example, like "README.info".

- DIR <name>
  Specify root directory to traverse and process.
  If this parameter is not given, use the current directory as root.
  Cannot be used together with FILE parameter.

  NOTE:
   Using this parameter, after processing, script exits with:
     RC=0 : all info file processed and some/all updated
     RC=1 : all info files processed, no file was updated

- FILE <file.info>
  Specify a single INFO file to process.
  Cannot be used together with DIR parameter.

  NOTE:
   Using this parameter, after processing, script exits with:
     RC=0 : info file processed and updated
     RC=1 : info file processed, but not updated
  
- DELTT <tooltype>
  Delete ToolType (if it is not commented).

- DELEA
  Delete ToolType EXECUTEARGS (if it is not commented).
  Equivalent to DELTT EXECUTEARGS.

- CMTTT <tooltype>
  Comment ToolType (if it is not commented).

- UNCMTTT <tooltype>
  UnComment ToolType, commented with ";" "*" or "( )".

  NOTE:
  Using parameter UNCMTTT when both uncommented and commented lines of a
  tooltype exist, this option will do nothing.
  
  For example, "UNCMTTT ATT" with existing:
  
   ATT=value1
   ;ATT=value2
   
  will result in
   
   ATT=value1
   ;ATT=value2

  Using parameter UNCMTTT when various commented lines of a tooltype exist,
  will remove all lines, except the last one (which is uncommented).
  
  For example, "UNCMTTT ATT" with existing:

   ;ATT=value1
   ;ATT=value2
   ;ATT=value3
   
  will result in
   
   ATT=value3

- SETTT <tooltype[=value]>
  Set/Update ToolType (with a value, if given).
  Commented ToolTypes are ignored.

  NOTE:
  If there are duplicate ToolTypes, they are removed,
  keeping only the command line one, passed to the script.

- SETSLAVE <method>
  Set/Update SLAVE ToolType, using method:
   method=1 : SLAVE=<the INFO filename, but with .slave extension>"
   method=2 : SLAVE=<First file .slave found in same dir of INFO file>
  This will process ALL INFO files found in dir traversal, because
  it assumes none of them as the SLAVE tooltype. Because,
  by default, only INFO files with tooltype SLAVE are processed.
  You may want to use ALTSCAN to discard some unwanted INFO files.
  This parameter SETSLAVE must be used separately, and not in
  conjunction with the other tooltype manipulating parameters:
  DELEA, DELTT, CMTTT, UNCMTTT, SETTT or SETEACFG.

  NOTE:
  If there are duplicate ToolTypes, they are removed,
  keeping only the command line one, passed to the script.

- CREATECFG
  Create a cfg file with the SLAVEs found on processed INFO files.
  The CFG file is to be used with the "ABR.rexx" script, and contains all
  Slave names found on ToolType SLAVE, sorted and with duplicates removed.
  A file "ABR.Created_by_WIB.cfg" will be created on current directory.
  Consult "ABR.rexx" documentation for further info on using the CFG file.

  TIP:
   dont use the CFG file with all entries listed, because is slower to parse.
   Remove the empty entries, and use only the entries you need.

- SETEACFG
  Create Tooltype "EXECUTEARGS=C <value of SLAVE>" for use with
  ABR.rexx script.
  The CONFIG value will be used as ID key for config files lookup:

    ABR.UAE.cfg
    ABR.EMU69.cfg
    ABR.MUSASHI.cfg
    ...

  NOTE:
  If there are duplicate ToolTypes, they are removed,
  keeping only the command line one, passed to the script.

- SETEALIST <listname>
  Specify LIST value for use with SETEACFG, this will create Tooltype:
    
    EXECUTEARGS=L <listname> C <value_of_SLAVE>
    
  for use with ABR.rexx script.
  The LIST will be used for the name of config files lookup:

    ABR.<listname>.UAE.cfg
    ABR.<listname>.EMU69.cfg
    ABR.<listname>.MUSASHI.cfg
    ...

  For example "SETEALIST Games" will create tooltype:
  
    EXECUTEARGS=L Games C Lotus

  and then it uses files:

    ABR.Games.UAE.cfg
    ABR.Games.EMU69.cfg
    ABR.Games.MUSASHI.cfg
    ...

- SETEAINFO
  This param adds the name of the processed INFO file to EXECUTARGS tooltype:
  
    EXECUTEARGS=C Lotus I A-Games:L/Lotus/Lotus.info

  NOTE: The fullpath to INFO file cannot have spaces. If this happens, the
    script issues a warning and the I parameter is not added to EXECUTEARGS.
    To solve this, use paths (and info filename) with no spaces.
  NOTE2: The total length of the EXECUTEARGS tooltype line cannot exceed
    127 chars on the info file. If this happens, the script aborts processing.
    To solve this, reduce your fullpath length, for example, using ASSIGNs like
    "A-Games:" or "A-Demos:" to point to the root of your WHDLoad files.

- NOASK
  Assume YES to all questions.

- DEBUG
  Don't delete temporary files. Also provides some debug info.

- QUIET
  Suppress all console output, but still outputs to LOG (if used).
  Error messages and user interactove questions are always displayed on console.

FINAL NOTES:
  - Operation FILE and DIR cannot be used together.
  - Operstions SETEALIST and SETEAINFO require use of SETEACFG.
  - Only one operation (SET, DEL, CMT, UNCMT) is permitted per tooltype,
    but several operations can be used on different tooltypes, with
    the exception of the operation SETSLAVE, which must be used alone.
  - Tooltypes named "IM1" and "IM2" are not permitted (Amiga Newicons).

==============================================================================
EXAMPLES AND USAGE:

1) To add "EXECUTEARGS=C <slave_name>" to ALL .info files which have a
   ToolType "SLAVE=slave_name".

  Open Amiga shell and type:

    SYS:REXXC/RX WIB.rexx DIR <root> SETEACFG

  This will SET ToolType "EXECUTEARGS=C <slave_name>"
  to ALL info files which have a ToolType "SLAVE=slave_name".
  or, if you want to use a config file for a particular list (for Games):

    SYS:REXXC/RX WIB.rexx DIR <root> SETEACFG SETEALIST Games

  This will SET ToolType "EXECUTEARGS=L Games C <slave_name>"

  NOTE:
    you can use RX directly instead of SYS:REXXC/RX, if command RX is in PATH.
    The SYS:REXXC/RX is the AmigaOS general default location for RX.
    The RX executable looks for AREXX scripts in REXX: (this assign should be
    assigned by default on AmigaOS, and should point to SYS:S)

2) To delete ToolType "EXECUTEARGS" from .info files:

  Open Amiga shell and type:

    SYS:REXXC/RX WIB.rexx DIR <root> DELEA

  NOTE: delete will not work on commented Tooltypes.

3) To create a CFG file from processed .info files:

  Open Amiga shell and type:

    SYS:REXXC/RX WIB.rexx DIR <root> CREATECFG

  This will create a file "ABR.Created_by_WIB.cfg" on the
  current directory, and doesn't change any .info files by itself.
  The CFG file is to be used with the "ABR.rexx" script, and contains all
  Slave names found on ToolType SLAVE, sorted and with duplicates removed.
  Consult "ABR.rexx" documentation for further info on using the CFG file.
