Accelerator Board Reconfigurator - v1.0 by Nandgate/NMSA

READ-ME file for AREXX script ABR.rexx
=============================================================================
FAQ:

Q) So, what's this?

  I made this AREXX script for configurating amiga accelerator/emulator cards
  (like PiStorm, UAE...) before a game is launched via WHDLoad.

Q) What cards are supported?

  Currently, only WINUAE and PiStorm (EMU68 and Musashi).
  A "GENERIC" board is also supported, just to provide SHELL parameter.
  Another cards, config files and parameters can be added to script
  using same principles.

Q) How does it work?

  For WHDLoad (use the latest version), simply put:

    EXECUTEARGS=C <slavename>

  on the ToolTypes of the game, for example:

    EXECUTEARGS=C Lotus

  NOTE:
    Slavename must not have spaces.
    You should use same "slavename" name of Tooltype "SLAVE=slavename.slave",
    but without the ".slave" part. Then, just make sure the slavename exists
    on the configuration file.

  When the AREXX script is run via WHDLoad.prefs,
  it gets the parameter "CONFIG Lotus",
  and seaches for it in the configuration file
  (corresponding to the accelerator you are using):

   ABR.UAE.cfg     <-- config used if running in WINUAE
   ABR.EMU68.cfg   <-- config used if running in Pistorm with EMU68 mode
   ABR.MUSASHI.cfg <-- config used if running in Pistorm with Musashi mode
   ABR.GENERIC.cfg <-- config used if no accelerator card or not supported

  and it will match the Config line(s) starting with:

   |Lotus|ParamName=ParamValue|...|...|

  and configures accelerator parameters according to their pair name/value.

  If LIST command line parameter is used, you can customize your config files.
  For example, example command line parameter:

   LIST Games CONFIG Lotus

  will use configuration files:

   ABR.Games.UAE.cfg
   ABR.Games.EMU68.cfg
   ABR.Games.MUSASHI.cfg
   ABR.Games.GENERIC.cfg

Q) What are the advantages?

  - Automatic reconfiguration of accelerator cards accoding to a user
    defined config id, which can also be a game/demo when using WHDLoad.
  - To have configuration lists of settings according to the
    accelerator/emulator you are running.
  - Easy sharing and maintenance of configuration lists.
  - To switch the SDCARD between accelerators without modifying ToolTypes.

Q) What are the disadvantages?

  - Well, you still have to edit the ToolTypes to put a line
    "EXECUTEARGS=C <config>" there. Or use the WIB.rexx script.
  - You still have to modify WHDLoad own parameters/tooltypes manually.

Q) Can configuration file have duplicate configs?

  Yes. In that case they are execute by it's order on configuration
  file (same with the parameters).

  So, for "CONFIG Lotus", if a config file has:

   |Lotus|Param1=Value1|
   |Lutus|Param2=Value2|

  is the same as having:

   |Lotus|Param1=Value1|Param2=Value2|

  so, Param1 is executed first, then Param2 is executed next, and so on.
  
  NOTE: If command line "FIRSTMATCH" is used, only the first config line
    will be processed. Use this if you have very large config files,
    to avoid parsing the whole file.

Q) Is the AREXX script bound to WHDLoad?

  My goal is to try to keep the ABR.rexx script generic, so it can
  be used by any other Amiga software (like WHDLoad), or script.
  Also, i try to use only standard Amiga commands where possible,
  and minimize the use of libs or 3rd party commands, in order
  to reduce dependencies and install complexity.

Q) Why AREXX and not Amiga Shell?

  The first version was made in plain AmigaDOS shell script.
  But soon it revealed to have many limitations.
  Then, i thought what were the alternatives, and came up with AREXX,
  since it seems to be present in all(?) AmigaOS versions,
  and it's way more flexible.
  I am learning AREXX, never coded on it.

Q) What AmigaOS were used to test this?

  AmigaOS 3.2.2.1
  AmigaOS 3.9
  AmigaOS 3.5
  AmigaOS 3.1 with ClassicWorkbench v28

  others may work.
  They just need to have AREXX installed, and Assigns adjusted.

Q) Will this work with CaffeineOS?

  This was not tested, but there are issues that needs to be resolved first.
  For CaffeineOS you have to merge script "Checksystem" with Caffeine's.
  Both scripts also make use of variable ENV:BOARDNAME.

Q) Will this work with OS X-Y-Z ?

  Well, i don't know.

Q) What Amiga was used to test this?

  I used my only Amiga from my retro collection, a Pistormed Amiga600 rev 1.3
  and also WINUAE 5.0 emulator on PC. The A600 was also all modified by me:
  fully recapped, has a 8x KickStart switch, a 512KB-1MB Kick switch,
  Reset switch, new keyboard PCB, CF adapter on top of PCMCIA, has 2MB Chip
  RAM expansion with RTC, an internal Gotek with FlashFloppy with OLED and
  Rotator switch, and an BluePill STM32 with FF-OSD daughterboard,
  has an early PIStorm600 (without the fan connector) with a Raspberry PI3A+,
  and the HDD LED connected to the PI with a BS170 mosfet.
  The RF Modulator was removed, exposing both PI HDMI and USB connectors.
  An SDCARD extension is connected to the PI and fitted on the internal floopy
  slot. For software I use 2 SDCARDS, an 32GB for CaffeineOS, and another
  64GB with EMU68, Linux/Musashi and with 6 Amiga partitions Multi-Booting
  AmigaOS 3.1, 3.2.2.1, 3.5, 3.9. I have also built a new Amiga PSU,
  based on a MeanWell RT-65B, with a fused USB +5V output.

=============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS:

Things needed to run this script:

1) Hardware:

 - An Amiga with an supported accelerator card
   (at this moment PISTORM/EMU68 and PISTORM/MUSASHI).
   If you dont have an Amiga, you can still use WINUAE emulator.

2) Software

 - Amiga WINUAE emulator, is not required but good to have.

 Configured on AmigaOS:
 - AmigaOS with AREXX, like 3.1, 3.2.2, 3.5, 3.9. Others may work also.
 - Required Environment Variables:
    $BOARDNAME = board name running script (values: UAE, EMU68, MUSASHI)
    See attached files "Checksystem" and "User-Startup" on how to do this.
 - Required Environment Assigns:
    REXX = path to AREXX scripts, and also
           to this script and its config files ABR.*.cfg
    REXXC = path to AREXX executables (like RX)
    UAE = path to UAE commands (uae-configuration)
    EMU68 = path to Emu68 commands (emu68info, emucontrol, emu68downclocker)
    MUSASHI = path to Musashi commands (pi, pistorm, pisimple, piaudio)
 - Configuration files:
    ABR[.<LIST>].EMU68.cfg = config file for EMU68
    ABR[.<LIST>].UAE.cfg = config file for UAE
    ABR[.<LIST>].MUSASHI.cfg = config file for MUSASHI
 - WHDLoad latest version (at date is 18.9),
    which supporte "EXECUTEARGS", or will not work!
    See attached files "WhdLoad.prefs", "WHDLoad-Startup" and
    "WHDLoad-Cleanup" on how to do this.

=============================================================================
INSTALLATION:

Q) How to install?

1) If using UAE, create an UAE dir on amiga, and copy all files from
   the PC emulator "WINUAE/Amiga Programs" to it.
   This dir on amiga will be your "UAE:" assign.

2) If using PISTORM/EMU68, create an PISTORM/EMU68 dir on amiga, and copy
   all files from "Pistorm Tools" to it (with no sub-directories).
   This dir on amiga will be your "EMU68:" assign.

3) If using PISTORM/MUSASHI, create an PISTORM/MUSASHI dir on amiga, and copy
   files "pi", "pistorm", "pisimple", "piaudio" from the emulated A314-shared
   PiDisk: to it. This dir on amiga will be your "MUSASHI:" assign.

4) The remaing Assigns are need, and used as:

  REXX:  --> points to SYS:S directory, where .rexx scripts are
             (including the "ABR.rexx" script).
             Should already be assigned by default on AmigaOS.
  REXXC: --> points to where RX executable is, usually SYS:REXXC

5) copy script files to S: (same as Assign REXX:):

    ABR.HISTORY.txt
    ABR.README.txt
    ABR.rexx
    ABR.rexx.info

6) copy given config files to S: (same as Assign REXX:):

    ABR.EMU68.cfg
    ABR.GENERIC.cfg
    ABR.MUSASHI.cfg
    ABR.UAE.cfg

7) copy script to check your accelerator/emulator model to S:, like:

  NOTE: note that CaffeineOS already has a script with this name,
        so you might have to change it - you are on your own in this case!

  copy Checksystem to S:

8) Add contents of given "User-Startup" to your "User-Startup", and don't
   forget to change the "Assigns" to match your installation
   (see steps 1, 2, 3, 4).

9) Add contents of given "WHDLoad-Startup" to your "WHDLoad-Startup",
   and contents of given "WHDLoad-Cleanup" to your "WHDLoad-Cleanup".

   NOTE: your scripts must start with lines:
     .KEY L,C,I
     .BRA <
     .KET >

10) The given "WHDLoad.prefs" file is just for reference.
   Make sure following lines in "WHDLoad.prefs" call your "WHDLoad-Startup"
   and "WHDLoad-Cleanup" scripts (paths may change).

   ExecuteStartup=C:Execute S:WHDLoad-Startup  ; executed on WHDLoad startup
   ExecuteCleanup=C:Execute S:WHDLoad-Cleanup  ; executed on WHDLoad exit

11) Reboot amiga. Check if Assigns are OK and if AREXX script runs.

  Open a shell and run (if using a List "Games", using ABR.Games.*.cfg files):

    REXXC:RX REXX:ABR.rexx LIST Games CONFIG Check
    
  or simply (if not using a List, using ABR.*.cfg files):
  
    REXXC:RX REXX:ABR.rexx CONFIG Check

  Check script output. Resolve any errors before proceeding.
  If all ok, it will open an INFO dialog box with text "Seems to be working!".
  Repeat the check for all configured accelerators that you will use
  (UAE, Pistorm/emu68, Pistorm/musashi).

12) Add "EXECUTEARGS" to game ToolType, for example the game "Lotus":

  EXECUTEARGS=C Lotus

  NOTE1: if given a CONFIG is not found on the cfg file,
         then "CONFIG DEFAULT" is used from cfg file.
         You can use command line parameter "NODEFAULT" to avoid this.
  NOTE2: on launching game, if Tooltype "EXECUTEARGS" is not given,
         then "CONFIG WHDLoadStartup" is used (see WHDLoad-Startup provided).
         If "CONFIG WHDLoadStartup" is not found, then applies NOTE1.
  NOTE3: on exiting game, the "CONFIG WHDLoadCleanup" is used
         (see WHDLoad-Cleanup provided).
         If "CONFIG WHDLoadCleanup" is not found, then applies NOTE1.
  NOTE4: you have to use WHDLoad latest version (at date is 18.9),
         which supporte "EXECUTEARGS", or will not work!

13) Start the game and check if it works!

==============================================================================
COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS AND WHAT THEY DO:

- <CONFIG name>

  Specify config key name to search on config file.
  If key name not found on the config file, "DEFAULT" key name will
  be used on the same config file, unless param NODEFAULT is used.

- [LIST name]

  Specify name of list to use for config files.
  Config filenames format are:
  
    ABR[.<LIST>].<BOARDNAME>.cfg 
  
  If LIST name not specified, config filename format is simply:
  
    ABR.<BOARDNAME>.cfg 

  Where BOARDNAME is one of: GENERIC, UAE, EMU68, MUSASHI.
  The BOARDNAME value will depend on board detected by script "Checksystem".
 
- [INFO file]

  Specify INFO file for updating ToolTypes with WHD param on config file.
  After updating the INFO file, it is required to re-launch the game/demo
  again, with the new WHDLoad settings. A popup informative window will
  ask for this, unless the INFO file required no update.
  
  If INFO param not specified and WHD param on config file is used,
  a popup informative window will always appear and display which
  WHDLoad settings to (un)set manually.
  
- [NODEFAULT]

  Do not call the same config file with key "DEFAULT",
  if the original config key was not found.
  
- [FIRSTMATCH]

  Exit script on the first config key name matched line on config file.
  Use this if your config file is large.
  However, using this parameter will not process subsequent lines
  on config file, with the same config key name.
  
- [QUIET]

  Suppress output to console (except errors).

==============================================================================
EXAMPLES AND USAGE:

1) RX ABR.REXX LIST Games CONFIG Lotus INFO A-Games:L/Lotus/Lotus.info

  this will read config file:
  
    ABR.Games.<BOARDNAME>.cfg
  
  searching for a config key name named "Lotus":
  
    |Lotus|WHD=NOCACHE|board specific settings...|
 
  if config key name not found,
  it will search the config file again for key named "DEFAULT":

    |DEFAULT|board specific settings...|

  The BOARDNAME value will depend on board detected by script "Checksystem".
