Configuration files for PiStorm running baremetal EMU68

Please keep in mind that each configuration is specific
for each Raspberry PI or Compute Module version, and
might use parameters adjusted for that version
(like ARMCLK for changing PI ARM cpu clock speed).

So, if you test/use configuration files of another PI version,
that does not match your hardware, please set ARMCLK parameters
accordingly (or remove these parameters).
